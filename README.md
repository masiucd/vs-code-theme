# React app with Ts and using json place holder

Testing and trying out to find a new concept how to structure up a React Typescript app with **Context API**.
Trying to think in the REdux land as much a possible but without taking in any extra dependents.

### Tools so far! 😎λ⚛️🐼

* React

* Typescript

* Styled components

* Context API

* Json place holder API
