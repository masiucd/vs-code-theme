# Masiu theme 🎨👩🏻‍🎨

This is my VS code theme. It is a clone of the very popular _Night owl theme_ by [Sarah Drasner](https://github.com/sdras)

I love the theme and the Italic style, specially if you using a font like _Operator mono_ or _Dank mono_.
I just wanted less italic so I forked the theme and just changed the configuration when it should be italic ore not, just how I liked it.

### Example 1

<img src="./ex1.png" width="6000" />

### Example 2

<img src="./ex2.png" width="6000" />
